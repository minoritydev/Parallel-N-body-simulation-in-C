# Parallel-N-body-simulation-in-C
Parallel and sequential n-body simulation program in C, with performance benchmarks. <br>
## N-body problem
The N-body problem is simply to compute the trajectory of objects in space as
driven by gravitational forces. You can find more details about the problem here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-body_simulation

## To run the program locally:
Sequential:
- compile with `make`. <br>
- Run `nbody/nbody-seq 32 2 nbody.ppm 1000000`. <br>
This means that there are 32 bodies, 1000000 iterations, the PPM output is done by
mapping nbody.ppm (and is sized by that fileâ€™s initial content), and the PPM file is
updated every 2 seconds. For details about the PPM format, see here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm <br>
- Optionally, to see how the bodies interact, open another terminal while the program is running and use `display -update 2 nbody.ppm`<br>the above command simply says to keep refreshing the display every 2 seconds.

Parallel: 
- compile with `make`
- Run `mpiexec -n 4 nbody/nbody-par`. <br>
You will need the MPI library for C. `-n` specifies the number of cores to run the program on.
